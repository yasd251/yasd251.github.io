    <p>Welcome to the programming course.</p>

<p>In this course we will be mainly focusing on learning the foundational aspects of learning a programming language, the language that we will be learning will be Python.</p>

<p>You may consider a programming language to be a type of method or “language” to instruct the computer, there are many other programming languages such as C++, Swift, Javascript, Rust, etc… (all of these have their pros and cons)</p>

<p>After installing Python, you will need an IDE to interact and code in that specific language, you can even use your text editor, but it will be preferred to use an IDE (Integrated development environment) as it will have certain features such as function auto-fill and syntax checking in order to ensure that you are typing correct code.</p>

<p>Once installed, you are ready to learn!</p>
<h1 id="how-to-use-this-course">How to use this Course.</h1>
<p>If you haven’t learned programming before, it may be quite a different experience as programming usually requires a ton of problem solving skills in the context of fixing bugs that occur within the projects and programs you plan to do in the future. It also requires enthusiasm, without enthusiasm for programming, you will find the things we do to be rather purposeless.</p>

<p>Therefore, to use this course, have somewhat of a passion for curiosity in programming, and a willingness to learn more each day.</p>

<p>I will be here to guide you in person so that you aren’t lost when learning, I hope to produce an environment of enthusiastic and curious learners that ask the “stupid” and sometimes insightful questions.</p>

<p>When given a new topic, spend just 5 minutes trying to learn what you can about it online from Secondary or Primary sources, rather it be YouTube Videos, w3schools.org, or any other medium.</p>
