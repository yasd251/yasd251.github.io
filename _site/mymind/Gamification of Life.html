    <p>I always wondered whether life could be somewhat comparable to a video game in terms of the constructs that are usually found within video games.</p>

<p>Can we use the Skill Tree, which is a feature within games, as a mental model within our life?</p>

<p>Would we be able to use these constructs to our advantage? To make our life a little more structured?</p>

<p>Although, is there even a point to make life structured in this way?</p>

<p>These are some questions I have, but the prospect of gamifying life seems enticing albeit the unfeasibility of it all..</p>
