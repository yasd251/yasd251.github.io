    <p>Learning in public is a process of learning, it is the act of learning something first, then publishing your thoughts, ideas, and notes on that certain topics in any form, it just has to reach a public audience. This can be in the form of a blog post (something like this), a YouTube Video, or an Instagram post, anything that allows an audience to learn about what you have learned.</p>

<p>A benefit of learning is succinctly articulated within <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-motivation-and-mindset#the-learning-process">The Odin Project</a>, it states:</p>

<p><em>“Teaching what you know to others is a great way to solidify what you have learned and can often reveal holes in your knowledge that you wouldn’t have identified otherwise.”</em></p>

<p>Learning in public takes a form of courage to really do, it takes the willingness to have the stamina to consistently learn and show your, to be humble and open to feedback, and above all, a willingness to look really, really stupid.</p>

<p>I encourage you to try Learning in Public, and may the benefits of learning in public come to you.</p>

<p>As of the time I’m writing this, I will be creating a Learner’s Wiki for all subjects and perhaps even things you are interested in, where I research and write all about what I learned from the web and reflections upon what and how I am learning this.</p>
