    <p>This idea came about from when I was in English Class, our class had to input all of the notes into a document regarding the method of how to structure a task called the Individual Oral and we had to create our own graphic organiser for the information within the IO, from this, an idea stemmed.</p>

<p>What if we had a platform for students to collaboratively add their own notes into a collection of school notes for all subjects, their experiences, their advice for new, incoming students, ideas, blogs, etc… Much like a mixture of Reddit and Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The Class of DP 1 will be shortly testing the feasibility of this idea and hopefully everyone will at least contribute something to the vault.</p>

<p>Our tentative names for the “wiki” are currently:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Thunderhead (heh)</li>
  <li>The Student’s Catalogue</li>
  <li>Vault of Knowledge (VoK)</li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully this idea can slowly branch out to something more significant, perhaps school wide to other grades and have it last across multiple alumnis.</p>
