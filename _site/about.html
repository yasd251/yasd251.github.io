    <p>the 251 is a personal static website acting as a web-journal of sorts, ideas, projects that i’m working on, blogs, anything of interest goes here!</p>

<p>This static website ensures a lightweight and minamalistic experience by its overall simplistic design (which is my excuse for not touching front-end thingsss)</p>

<p>I like to write short-essays on subjects that I find interesting, I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I like writing them</p>
