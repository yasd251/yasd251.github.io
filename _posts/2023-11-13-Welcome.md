The following blog has been made with Jekyll, which was a pain to set up, but its done now.

It's hard to describe what this site could be, but the closest I could I describe it is that I believe that the site is similar to a  journal or kind of like a pocketbook on the web. 

I guess you could call it a portfolio website
