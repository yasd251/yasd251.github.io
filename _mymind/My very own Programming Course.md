title: My Programming Course

I will be starting a trial class soon where I will be teaching the basics and some intermediate topics of programming in Python to my classmates. I wish that this will hopefully branch out towards the other grade levels. It's also a good experience for me in terms of how do I articulate concepts to a complete beginner.

I have devised two different pathways for learning in this course, Basic, and Accelerated.

This touches upon a concept that I was thinking of talking about called: "Hyper-accelerated learning" where an individual attains the habit to acquire skills and knowledge in an extremely expeditious manner in any topic through the ability to adapt to the nuances and new information being bombarded when learning a new topic..

The differentiation between Basic and Accelerated is to help sieve out the people who want to really learn coding and the people who may just want to acquire the basics.

Perhaps something like this can branch out into something bigger, like a course about how to learn skills and topics, rather than just learning programming.

I hope to also explore and have discussions together with my classmates regarding the beauty and nature of programming, and with how it develops a certain "mode" of thinking within those who are well-versed within the field of programming.

I want to create an environment where I can also learn from the people I am tutoring too, and it's not just a one-way teaching method. Instead, taking advantage of the peer-learning will prove to be extremely beneficial towards me as well.

I hope the people I will be tutoring too will be passionate about learning. Perhaps, I could introduce first the power of programming, rather than diving straight in.

I really hope this will be a successful implementation. I plan to start this week and I have already planned out the topics of which I will be teaching within the scope of Python.

I had a very productive and interesting conversation with some of classmates after I showed them what programming could do. It was cool to see that people's enthusiasm started to build after seeing the programs that I made that had actually a useful application.

If any of the people who are in this course reads this, please do contact me about what you think of the overall vision, and perhaps what additional ideas you may add to what I have said.

Can't wait.
