I found this website as I was prepping for Student Council's upcoming event: 
[Secret Santa: arcanis.github.io](https://github.com/arcanis/secretsanta)

What an absolute gem this is, thank you arcanis.

It works by dynamically generating links for people to click on in order to find out who their secret santa gift will be to. 

This link can then be sent via email or some other form.

So cool...
