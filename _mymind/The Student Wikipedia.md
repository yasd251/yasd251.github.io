title: "Idea: The Student's Wiki"

This idea came about from when I was in English Class, our class had to input all of the notes into a document regarding the method of how to structure a task called the Individual Oral and we had to create our own graphic organiser for the information within the IO, from this, an idea stemmed.

What if we had a platform for students to collaboratively add their own notes into a collection of school notes for all subjects, their experiences, their advice for new, incoming students, ideas, blogs, etc... Much like a mixture of Reddit and Wikipedia.

The Class of DP 1 will be shortly testing the feasibility of this idea and hopefully everyone will at least contribute something to the vault.

Our tentative names for the "wiki" are currently:
1. Thunderhead (heh)
2. The Student's Catalogue
3.  Vault of Knowledge (VoK)

Hopefully this idea can slowly branch out to something more significant, perhaps school wide to other grades and have it last across multiple alumnis.
